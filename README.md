I basically changed the whole thing, some of it for worse (less features).

## Changes made
- Grabbing Tweet data using the API instead of HTML scraping (wasn't working anyway)
- Can now grab images and videos to repost

## TODO
Find a way to still grab URLs but remove only the URL that self-references the media in the tweet
Add support multiple configs/accounts back once I have a good way to do it
